                <p>
                    1.   Half-and-half + Butter
                    <br>
                    Because heavy cream is so high in fat, you can often create a substitute with other high-fat
                    ingredients. In terms of taste and consistency, a combination of Half-and-Half and butter is 
                    one of the best substitutes for heavy whipping cream. It tastes just like the real thing. As 
                    its name suggests, Half-and-Half is made up of whole milk and half cream, and its fat content 
                    is typically between 10.5% and 18%. By adding melted butter, which is around 80% fat, to the 
                    liquid, you can increase that fat content.
                    <br>
                    For this substitution, you'll want to combine3/4 cup Half-and-Half with 1/4 cup melted butter. 
                    This will replace 1 cup of heavy whipping cream. The substitute will work well in both cooking 
                    and baking, but it's not the best option for whipping. If you're willing to forgo a little 
                    richness, you could use all Half-and-Half as a 1-to-1 substitution and skip the butter entirely.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2. Milk + Butter
                    <br>
                    No Half-and-Half? You can make a similar heavy cream alternative using regular milk and butter. 
                    Whole milk has a fat percentage of around 3.5% and is preferable to lower-fat varieties, but 
                    you'll still want to use more melted butter than you would with Half-and-Half. For best results, 
                    try mixing 2/3 cup whole milk with 1/3 cup butter. Whisk well to combine before adding any baking 
                    or cooking projects. Again, you won't be able to whip this mixture into a topping.

                    3. Coconut cream
                    <br>
                    For a vegan cream substitute, consider using coconut cream. You can often spot coconut cream, which 
                    is thicker and higher in fat than coconut milk, on store shelves right alongside its kin. You can 
                    also steal it from a can of full-fat coconut milk. Chill the coconut milk overnight, then scoop the 
                    solidified coconut cream off the top, leaving the watery coconut liquid behind. Use this ingredient 
                    as a 1-to-1 substitute for heavy cream in the cooking, but not that it will impart a coconut flavor 
                    to your dish. Coconut cream also works well for creating a vegan, dairy-free whipped topping, To 
                    make coconut milk whipped cream, use an electric mixer to whip chilled cream on high speed until 
                    peaks form. If desired, you can add vanilla extract and a sweetener to help accentuate the topping's 
                    coconut flavor.

                    4. Milk + Cornstarch 
                    <br>
                    If you're looking for a substitute to add body to a stew or sauce, a combination of milk and 
                    cornstarch may do the trick. Cornstarch is low-calorie and low fat, and it will help to thicken your 
                    dish without imparting and flavor to it. To replace one cup of heavy cream, mix 2 tablespoons 
                    cornstarch into 1 cup milk, whisking well to break up any clumps. Cornstarch requires heat to thicken, 
                    so add the slurry to soups and sauces and simmer for at least 1 minute to activate the cornstarch.
